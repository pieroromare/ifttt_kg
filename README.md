### Interface
#### Visualise your IFTTT applications
In this dashboard the applications showed are taken from [IFTTT Top Applets 2025](https://ifttt.com/explore/top-applets-on-ifttt)
You can visualise an applciation by clicking to a node. Each node represents a service where IFTTT is connected to run the application.
The common application structure is IF THIS THEN THAT:
1) IF enter in the room THEN turn on the lights
2) IF like new video on Youtube THEN add on Spotify playlist (IFTTT App)[https://ifttt.com/applets/pc6CeRjs-add-songs-from-videos-you-like-to-a-spotify-playlist]
3) IF 7am THEN send me weather forecasting (IFTTT App)[https://ifttt.com/applets/YY9Mqgw5-get-the-weather-forecast-every-day-at-7-00-am]

#### Privacy Policy
In IFTTT, while running an application, it is assumed that the user is subscribed to the services connected.
Thus, when clicking a node, it is possible to visualise a summary of the privacy policy of that node.
